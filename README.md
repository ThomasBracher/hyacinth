# Hyacinth, the http mock on browser side

## Forewords
There is not much http mocking on the browser side and those existing are low-level or tied to a library. The goal of hyacinth is to create a high level http mock with no dependence to jQuery or another library. You will still need to work with a test framework.

## Getting Started
The core of Hyacinth is `hyacinth.Server`. It carries the expectations and responds in place of the original XMLHttpRequest.

```javascript
var server = new hyacinth.Server();

// Set up the expectations (explained below)

server.launch(); // replace the global.XMLHttpRequest with a fake

// Execute the http requests

server.shutdown(); // empty the expectations and bring the vanilla XMLHttpRequest back
```

###Â Setting up expectations

server has a high level api inspired by [connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect). There is a method for every http method, let's see how to make a GET request.

```javascript
server.get('/hello', function(req, res) {
	res.send('world');
});
```

As you might have guest, by making a GET request on /hello url, the fake server will respond to you with a world text response. req and res are respectively instance of Response and Request attached to the underlying fake XMLHttpRequest.

Documentation still to be written. thx for your patience.
