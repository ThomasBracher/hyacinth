# Hyacinth, the http mock on browser side

## Forewords
There is not much http mocking on the browser side and those existing are low-level or tied to a library. The goal of hyacinth is to create a high level http mock with no dependence to jQuery or another library. You will still need to work with a test framework.

## Getting Started
The core of Hyacinth is `hyacinth.Server`. It carries the expectations and responds in place of the original XMLHttpRequest.

```javascript
var server = new hyacinth.Server();

// Set up the expectations (explained below)

server.launch(); // replace the global.XMLHttpRequest with a fake

// Execute the http requests

server.shutdown(); // empty the expectations and bring the vanilla XMLHttpRequest back
```

### Setting up expectations

server has a high level api inspired by [connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect). There is a method for every http method, let's see how to make a GET request.

```javascript
server.get('/hello', function(req, res) {
	res.send('world');
});
```

As you might have guest, by making a GET request on /hello url, the fake server will respond to you with a world text response. req and res are respectively instance of Response and Request attached to the underlying fake XMLHttpRequest.

## Documentation

### Server

This is the constructor of the server

```javascript
var server = new hyacinth.Server();
```

#### launch()

It saves the current global XMLHttpRequest by a interceptor. It does not affect expectations. They can be declared before or after the server is launched, they will be registered still.

#### shutdown()

It replaces the fake XMLHttpRequest setted by `server.launch` by the original one. It also erases every expectation registered.

#### verb(url, handler)

_verb_ has to be replace with one of the following:
* get
* post
* put
* delete
* head
* options

It register a handler to any request using the _verb_ http method and to the url.
* url can be either a string or a regexp. If you want more url filtering, see Request object below.
* handler is a function with two parameter: `function(req, res)` req and res being respectively a Request and a Response instance.

### Request

#### body([type])

You can parse the body of the request with the type. type can be one of these:
* json
* that's it for now

If you want the raw body just call `body()`.

#### getHeader(header)

Returns the header's value in the request.

#### url  _property_

Returns the url passed to complete the handler. It should be useful for parsing it and returning query string or else.

### Response

#### send([status | body], [body])

This function is used to respond to the incoming request. You can simply use it as a confirmation by specifying nothing `res.send()`. It will by default send a 200 OK response with an empty body. Only specifying the body will send a 200 OK response with the body described. It will otherwise send the specified request.
All headers or else specified before will be send with the response.

#### json([status | object], [object])

This utility does the same as `res.send(status, body)` except that it will set up the XMLHttpRequest and the Content-Type header to simulate a json response. It does exactly the same as `send()`.

#### setHeader(header, value)

Sets the value of the specified header. Headers are sent with `send()` or `json()` methods.
